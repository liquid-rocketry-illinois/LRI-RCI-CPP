# LRI Rocket Control Interface

C++ version of the UI for controlling rockets and test stands by implementing the host side of the 
Rocket Control Protocol (RCP).

This project is still heavily in development, and contains mostly experimental code. Please don't
judge me yet I promise it will get better.
