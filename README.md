# LRI Rocket Control Interface

C++ version of the UI for controlling rockets and test stands by implementing the host side of the
Rocket Control Protocol (RCP).

This project is mostly complete, and only needs more intense testing to be considered complete. Also on the todo list is
better heartbeat handling and a window icon (and maybe some UI stylizing).
